--------------------------------------
Sequence
I tend to use music or have videos in the background to help me think of ideas. I tend to mindlessly look at Twitter and Facebook, and post videos with music in it. It's odd, isn't it? Videos in particular feel like a half-ass marketing ploy, but I'm not a marketer. I listen to kpop songs at times but I don't intend to learn the dancing so much. Yet, I share things thinking of such actions but I'm not actually doing anything. It's like a strand of clustered hair cells with weak keratin(a smoothener).

I post things on Facebook, but I clustered the intention of "future use" with "social media outreach". Instagram and Facebook are for reaching out to people.

If I were to make 20-second ads regarding Deleuzian thoughts, the idea of music is to be used as a signifier within the medium of television. It's something to be repeated within that medium over and over.

If I were to make movies, the purpose is repetition within that medium.

If I were to post on Instagram, what exactly is the point? 10 years from now seeing thousands of one-shot posts that are hardly legible without an extremely caution liberian.  What is it that I want to repeat in these mediums? If they're for one-time posts, then it's almost pointless, unless it's to reach out.

I write philosophy related posts, but they're meant to mirror my active process of creating. It's a railway; a means for others to maybe mimic my way of producing things. That too means nothing if I have not actually done anything.

❕I need to smoothen the clusters. I don't care to make movies per se or to reach out to people. I want to accurately convey how I design context. I don't think reaching out to the masses is necessary for this. As long as I and anyone else that reads it is able to follow along from scratch and produce their own context. If one can read Deleuze, one can read my work(s).

The point of this
In my case, I've been thinking of using some combination of Boku narration and Steinback-like transitions(1). Some combination of "collapse"  with Sosekian hero archetype and chapter-by-chapter resolutions echoing Deleuze's asymmetry as imprints(2).
❕I want the act of novelizing non-local ideas to be similar to pole vaulting; ideas that seem to have no ready home in literature but are nonetheless positioned, flung, and aimed somewhere within the manifold. (3)

(1) I want to use imagery to introduce and advance the plot of the story. Tactile imagery-->something goes on in this one place, some resolve and conflict --> tactile imagery-->something goes on at a transitioned place, some resolve, some conflict.

(2)Displaying what should be ideal dialects, and "collapse" them into asymmetric spurts of becoming. Useable and aesthetically pleasing proses that I call "imprints". A resolution that is ever so cruel yet pleasing.
"Work of a calculating god whose numbers fail to add up, he says (DR, 222). The effect is a basic injustice, an “irreducible inequality,” that is “the world” (222). “If the calculations were exact there would be no world,” Deleuze argues, that makes the world itself the “remainder” that is “the real in the world understood in terms of fractional or even incommensurable numbers” (222).

(3)When I say "non-local" I'm loosely thinking of Deleuze's idea of the "nomad". the local being the familiar. A metaphysical sequence of thinking that is not discussed so much anywhere.
