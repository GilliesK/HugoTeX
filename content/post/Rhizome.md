It's not so much what I do say but what I contrast it with and leave out.
Collectively, I'm thinking of ideas said before:
```
◉A word matrix of individual collocations affected differently based on a weak-medium-strong system .
◉The contemporaneous free indirect speech prose I referred to earlier: The idea
of a contemporaneous past, present, and future presented in the paragraph; the protagonist
interacting with the future and past while seemingly in the present.
◉Canonizing linguistic terms that will help to understand the book's chrestomathy
```


But what does this look like? I like the structure of anime *Clannad* in which the narrative,without warning,
is in the future, and then suddenly the narrative is in the present; or like the on-going manga *Attack on Titan* in which characters randomly spoil things
that will be in the future pages; what occurred in the past seemingly repeating in the current page. (1)I'm thinking
of the chapters being labeled by the matrix of selectivied words; two of matrix words/groups highlighted in conveying an
analogued language that the reader subconsciously picks up on and can reiterate on their own. (i.e it if it's a
chinese collocation matrix, the reader knows more or less what the word means and how it would be used based on
the varying degrees individual groups/words were highlighted and correspond with the analogued paragraph).

I like the idea of a milieu being a reoccurring prolégein: An introduction that encompasses the complexity of the rhizome.
Going to this again and again, with the idea of cutting away from particular lines of becoming as a sign of contrastー to amplify the story
based on these contrasts. (2)The milieu is literately functional if I can incorporate the matrix and prose structure ideas; these incorporations
are tools to (re/de)territorialize the milieu and retroactively capture différenciations.

Footnotes:
(1)Clannad started off rather cliché and *Attack on Titan*'s  plot was standard storytelling but, for what seemed like spilling water on the pages, information from individual pages were deluged{arrived at the same time}. From the moment the protagonist wakes, the story was set in stone. Towards Attack on Titan's climax we found out the protagonist was actively affecting the past to be this way, which gave an entirely different perspective to things that originally seemed off. The author himself purposely spoiled the ending a few years ago by showing the final page to the public without context. For *Clannad*, it was originally a light novel game with multiple endings, which made the random time leaps for each individual story route quite interesting.

(2)My headspace here is somewhat in Raymond Queneau's *Exercise in Style*. In other words, the same story is told multiple times in several different angles and beginnings, leaving some stuff out and focusing on other properties.
