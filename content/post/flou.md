『Regarder l'art, c'est comme chercher un mot juste.L'art est comme le marquée, les problèmes que l'on pense en regardant l'exposition sont vis à vis.Cela devient un letimotiv à mesure que l'on traverse la vie, une idée fixe qui ressemble à un cadre photo. Le cadre photo pour voir le milieu autour de moi.』
(eng: Looking at art is like looking for a just word. Art is like a marquee: The problems thought of while looking at the exhibition are inextricably intertwined with art itself. The art becomes a leitmotiv as one goes through life; an idée fixe that is like a picture frame. The picture frame to view the milieu around me.)

Pardon me, I had to write out my initial thoughts in French as I feel "mot juste"(just word), " vis à vis"(side by side), "idée fixe"( leitmotiv),  "milieu", and the color-coding behind them align better in French than in English.

Something about art expositions intrigues me. Say, look at a picture, and what set of questions come to mind? I remember looking at a college mathematics textbook in 7th grade and enjoying it more so because it felt like an art exhibition, and it was my job to(one day) provide an exposition. I think my 2015-2018 fanatic machine learning and "statistic messages had less to do with a hermetically focusing on praxis and more so providing exposition in somewayー I feel I've lost this.  Even the email's title, "flou", meaning "blurry" "faint", has to do with my feeling nowadays;  metaphysical lethargy in away. I'm able to explain things for their particular goal but it's a flou-like feeling nowadays compared to before.
