Firstly, I want to give some background:
I want  to care about  territories
that will feel  meaningful someday.
It is  like waiting by a geyser (間欠泉)
I want  to write literature within
the territories’ milieus(ドゥルズー単語: 環境の現れ),
about these milieus, that
will eventually lead to one’s own sense of
territory and accomplishment

Because the milieus viewed via articulating
a forest's abstraction highlights what Boehme calls,
“power,color, virue”(1). What we view of
the forest is, in deleuzian terms, a refrain, a
repetition of these collective mileus; a habit that
allows variation. Borrowing the German neologism,
Gefassete , the internal mileus produce a temporary
existence as a representation of self in reflection
upon territory. Gasß meaning “container”, and fassen
meaning “to grasp”; the container will ossify and
succeed to be different; territory is reproduced
the same but what is in its container will be lost.
“Difference” is born from each recall of the forests.
In this case, I want to write noticing these
differenciations, waiting for the geyser to burst(2).
I want to make aesthetic essays on mutiplicity
and time duration. Ideas on perception and memory.
