Going to write some things here

```
Firstly, I want to give some background:
I want you to care about  territories
 that you feel will be meaningful someday.
It is  like waiting by a geyser (間欠泉)
I want you to write literature within
the territories’ milieus(ドゥルズー単語: 環境の現れ),
about these milieus, that
will eventually lead to one’s own sense of
territory and accomplishment

Because the milieus viewed via articulating
the forests abstraction highlights what Boehme calls,
“power,color, virue”(Boehme citation). What we view of
the forests are, in deleuzian terms, a refrain, a
repetition of these collective mileus; a habit that
allows variation. Borrowing the German neologism,
Gefassete , the internal mileux produce a temporary
existence as a representation of self in reflection
upon territory. () Gasß meaning “container”, and fassen
meaning “to grasp”; the container will ossify and
succeed to be different; territory is reproduced
the same but what is in its container will be lost.
“Difference” is born from each recall of the forests.
In your case, I want you to write noticing these
differenciations* , waiting for the geyser to burst.
I want to you to make aesthetic essays on mutiplicity
and time duration. Ideas on perception and memory.
